}
```

## Step-by-Step Update Process

1. **Open** `portfolio-data.json` in your text editor
2. **Find** the section you want to update (e.g., "publications")
3. **Copy** one of the example entries above
4. **Modify** it with your actual information
5. **Save** the file
6. **Test** by running `python serve.py` and viewing in browser
7. **Verify** your changes appear correctly

## Tips for Success

‚úÖ **Use double quotes** for all strings in JSON  
‚úÖ **Add commas** between array items (but not after the last one)  
‚úÖ **Validate JSON** at jsonlint.com before saving  
‚úÖ **Keep backups** of your data file  
‚úÖ **Update incrementally** - add one item at a time and test  

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå Using single quotes: `'text'` ‚Üí Use `"text"`  
‚ùå Trailing commas: `[item1, item2,]` ‚Üí Remove last comma  
‚ùå Missing commas: `{a: 1} {b: 2}` ‚Üí Add comma between objects  
‚ùå Unescaped quotes in text: Use `\"` for quotes inside strings  

## Next Steps

1. Start with **personal information** - update your email, phone, etc.
2. Add your **real education** and **experience**
3. Add **one project** to test the system
4. Add **one publication** if you have any
5. Update **social media links**
6. Test everything works
7. Continue adding more content over time!
