I worked on the design, simulation, and prototyping of multiple robotic systems including drones, unmanned ground rovers, manipulator arms, and legged robots. This experience allowed me to develop proficiency in Python, C++, ROS (Robot Operating System), and microcontroller/processor programming for robot control and monitoring. I extensively used CAD tools like Fusion 360 and SolidWorks for mechanical design, combined with 3D printing for rapid prototyping. \n\n\n\nAfter my internship, I was retained as a Support Staff where I taught and supervised trainees' research implementations in the robotics department. This role enhanced my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills as I guided students through complex robotics projects."

These projects strengthened my foundation in circuit analysis, electrical circuit design, control systems, and embedded systems, while developing my problem-solving and creativity skills. I utilized MATLAB for system modeling and simulation, and applied my knowledge of mechanical, electrical, and automation integration to bring these projects to life. \n\n\n\nMy final year project was later published in the IAES International Journal of Robotics and Automation (IJRA) in June 2024, under the supervision of Dr. Samuel Owoeye."

I worked on the repair and maintenance of industrial equipment such as double girder cranes, pumps, motors, hydraulic systems, and electrical grid systems, under the supervision of Engrs. Naresh, Alok, Adams, Ahmed, and Sunil. This role deepened my understanding of electrical connections, circuit analysis, and industrial automation systems. I applied my adaptability and teamwork skills to work effectively in a multicultural engineering team, troubleshooting complex electrical and mechanical systems in a fast-paced high-pressure manufacturing environment.        \n\n\n\nIn 2021, my third year at FUNAAB, I interned at Nigerian Breweries PLC in Ibadan Nigeria. Working as an Automation Engineer under the supervision of Engr. Temple, I was responsible for the bi-weekly calibration of sensors across the factory using the BEAMEX MC5 calibrator, and the maintenance of the factory's automation systems. I also collaborated in the development of a pedestrian safety system for the logistics department using sensors and automation technologies, and created a real-time solution for an on-site CO2 leak, reportedly reducing production downtime by 50%. This experience kickstarted my skill development in automation, electrical circuit design, and problem-solving in real-world industrial applications."
